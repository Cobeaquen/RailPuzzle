-a limited amount of force
-a limited amount of time / keeping track - give points based on how long it took for all the carts to get to their goal.
-obstacles (random each turn maybe?)
-hills and bumps - tiles that require more energy to cross.
-portals!!! - they lead to another portal on the map!
-Show new features and elements as the game progress.
-environments - like a cave with limited lighting, environment is related to the level - advance from environment to environment, different backgrounds (and textures like obstacles)
-change turn direction of a turn-rail when train passes - makes it harder to manage other trains
-multiple goals and trains with different variables
-ability for user to create their own levels
-picking up/leaving items to make your cart lighter/heavier
-leaving some static tracks on the map for the player to expand on
-daily challenges (do this when the game is done)
-make a turning rail that throws the cart of the track if it's going too fast.
-make the carts able to press UI buttons to do things, like spawn more carts.
-introduce new mechanics in every environment (make the first levels easy, to show how the mechanics work)
-fix physics - maybe lerp velocity using time; (startvel, endvel, t)
-create a parameter for placing rails - if we should modify the map or not
-put a blocker into place to stop the cart from going over that tile
-carts chained to each other to make them unable to go seperate ways
-make the finish rail stop every cart that tries to pass, until the player has picked up every orb.

Progress 2019-04-24:
Shaders and light experimentaion in hlsl
Added Windows DX reference because of shaders not working properly with Desktop GL.

Progress 2019-04-25:
+resource system
+Simple UI that displays materials (not done yet)
+Concept design
+Start of map - start point and endpoint, readable/writeable to a file.

Progress: 5%

WORKING LIST:
a limited amount of time / keeping track X
-begin with obstacles + TEXTURE X
-hills and bumps X
-change turn direction of a turn-rail when cart passes x (not really done)
-portals
-make some static rails that you have to pass to win the level. (some kind of orb maybe) X
-create some simple levels with one cart (experiment)
-create a new button for reseting the level, and change the one that kills the cart.
-find a solution for reseting the level and storing items placed by the player.
-make new class for placable items X
-allow multiple connections from one output X
-detector rail
-logic gates
-checking for turns when exiting portal
-power modules - inverter (X) shortener and extender
-detector rail fix - keep it active only when the rail touches the track X
-signal- extender and shortener powermodules
-possibility to have multiple carts travelling at once
-logic gates
-ui - no more scrolling!! tab attached to the side for things to build (DESIGN FIRST)
-make some early title screen that tells information about the game

-fix the level completion logic: set a cell to be the completion cell for each level (same for the start)
-improve editor: display consumption of resources live + 
limit the railtrack length to amount of available resources + 
fix bug: place rails in the correct spot

POSSIBLE OPTIMIZATIONS:
-make the list on the level class of type Cell, instead of obstacle - that way we store everything in one variable and in fewer places
-make 'isEmpty' variable on cell
